== Vacuum

Removes unused data from storage.

Working with the current running sandbox, the vacuum command will clean up the version history and the index segments that are not in use.
To also clean up binary files and data, add the `-b` option.

To list available configuration options, type:

----
$ enonic vacuum -h
